# ðŸš€ Railway Deployment Guide

Follow these steps to deploy your Embroidery Inventory Manager to Railway for external access.

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

### Option A: Using GitHub Website (Easiest)
1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click the **"+"** button in the top right
3. Select **"New repository"**
4. Repository name: `embroidery-inventory-manager`
5. Description: `Professional embroidery inventory management system`
6. Make it **Public** (required for free Railway)
7. **Don't** initialize with README (we already have files)
8. Click **"Create repository"**

### Option B: Using Command Line
```bash
# Create repository on GitHub (you'll need GitHub CLI installed)
gh repo create embroidery-inventory-manager --public --description "Professional embroidery inventory management system"

# Push your code
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/embroidery-inventory-manager.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 2: Deploy to Railway

3. Click **"Deploy from GitHub repo"**
4. Sign in with GitHub if prompted
5. Find and select your `embroidery-inventory-manager` repository

## Step 3: Configure Your App

Railway will automatically:

## Step 4: Get Your Public URL

1. Once deployed, click on your project

4. Look for a message like: `Your app is live at: https://your-app.railway.app`
5. **Copy this URL** - this is your public access point!

## Step 5: Test External Access

1. Open the Railway URL in a new browser tab
2. Test all features:
   - Add customers
   - Add inventory items

### If deployment fails:
